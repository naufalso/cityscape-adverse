# Cityscape-Adverse üåÜ

A robust benchmark for evaluating semantic segmentation models under adverse conditions using diffusion-based scene modifications.

## Overview

Cityscape-Adverse extends the original Cityscapes dataset by introducing realistic environmental variations generated through diffusion-based image editing. It provides a comprehensive benchmark for testing semantic segmentation model robustness under:

- üåßÔ∏è Weather variations
- üí° Lighting conditions
- üçÇ Seasonal changes

> This project is built on [MMSegmentation](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmsegmentation) by OpenMMLab.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **MMSegmentation Installation**
```bash
# Follow the detailed installation guide
pip install -v -e .
```
See [detailed installation instructions](docs/en/get_started.md#installation) for more options.

2. **Diffusion Tools Setup**
```bash
pip install -r requirements/imageedit.txt
```

### Dataset Access

#### Option 1: Download Pre-generated Dataset
Access our dataset through:
- ü§ó Huggingface: [naufalso/cityscape-adverse](https://huggingface.co/datasets/naufalso/cityscape-adverse)
- CLI Download:
```bash
python tools/editing/download_cityscape_adverse.py
```

#### Option 2: Generate Custom Data
